A quick python script to pull saved images from a reddit account. Also downloads gifv as an mp4 file.

Use pip to install missing modules (most likely praw and pillow).
Requires a Reddit api token to be generated for the relevant account.

TODO: Test reddit accounts that have saved posts as well as images. This will probably throw an exception at the moment.
